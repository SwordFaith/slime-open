Global pytest configuration for Slime framework.

This file is reserved for truly cross-module fixtures.
Currently, all module-specific fixtures are defined in their respective conftest files:
- tests/router/conftest.py: Router-specific fixtures
- tests/backends/conftest.py: Backend-specific fixtures (future)
- tests/rollout/conftest.py: Rollout-specific fixtures (future)
